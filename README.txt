== Description ==

You order. They pay.

This app enables the YouPay system in your OpenCart store.
Allowing your users to checkout with a product and then send a payment link to someone else to pay for them.
This is great for people who don't have credit cards, like teenagers, who often need to buy things online but do not have a credit card. It also takes the hassle out of buying things for your partner.

Please see youpay.ai for more information.
